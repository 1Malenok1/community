# Althea DeFi Participant Community

Althea networks are networks built using the Althea ecosystem, which includes the protocol, software on devices, connectivity hardware, and of course the blockchain component of the Althea blockchain. Participants in this community include token holders who secure the network through votes and participation, validators, and end users.

### Validators

For the Althea blockchain, there is a role of validator that is crucial to securing the network. While the network is still in testnet, there are many validators currently validating on the blockchain. You can [read more about being a validator here in this article](https://blog.althea.net/validate/).

*As the validator process was invite-only from the first testnet, if you weren't already part of the first testnet but would like to become a validator, you'll need to wait until mainnet.*

If you've already been accepted as a validator previously, [here is the official docs on how to run a validator](https://github.com/althea-net/althea-zone).


If you're already a validator and you have issues or want a role on Discord, please use the [Althea Validators channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/477147257251299350/595286622178639892). If you're a validator but not yet in that channel, use the [general discussion channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/477147257251299350/477147257251299352) and let an admin know the situation.
