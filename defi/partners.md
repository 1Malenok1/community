# Althea DeFi Partner Community

Althea networks are networks built using the Althea ecosystem, which includes the protocol, software on devices, connectivity hardware, and of course the blockchain component of the Althea blockchain. Partners in this community include EVM environment builders of incentive structures and programs built on top of the routers or other native micropayment applications such as with telecom and IoT.

This is the starting point for joining the community of DeFi partners. You may get help with your implementations, commit code, write docs, test implementations, report bugs, organize meetups, suggest ideas for the community.

For validators, voters, or end users of the blockchain, see the [DeFi Participants Community page](https://github.com/althea-net/communities/blob/main/defi/participants.md).
