# Althea in Antarctica

In order for Althea networks to deploy, grow, and scale sustainably, communities need to educate and support each other.

This open source repository will be the new home of support, planning, and education for communities utilizing Althea to build networks in Antarctica.

# Overview

* Antarctica is unreachable by undersea fiber optic as [cables would need to withstand shifting land masses and stable -50 degree celsius temperatures](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2207259.stm).
* Cellular signal is available [via networks like SigFox](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2016/01/19/antarctica-gets-a-cellular-network-for-the-internet-of-things/) but is designed for IoT and cannot handle streaming or browsing the internet like other mobile networks might provide.
* Internet is primarily provided by satellites owned by Iridium Communications for law data transmissions, [at an average cost of about $3 per email](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/how-to-ditch-the-internet-while-traveling/). 

# Summary

It's incredibly difficult to get internet signal to the continent of Antarctica, but once it's there Althea can be useful for the last-mile solutions.  


# Build a new community

If you can't find a community suitable to join, feel free to start your own!

By starting a community and becoming its ambassador, you will ultimately be responsible for maintaining it and:

* Providing the community’s information and intentions
* Collecting and providing the community’s contact information (infrastructure admin, ambassador’s contact information, etc)
* Updated community-specific resources, news, and external news that affect the network *(e.g. changes in laws that affect Althea, city ordinances that affect installed infrasture, security updates for hardware, etc)*
* Being a point-of-contact for anyone wanting to join said community

To start a community, [follow these instructions](#) here.
