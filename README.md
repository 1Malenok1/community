# Althea Community

In order for Althea networks to deploy, grow, and scale sustainably, communities need to educate and support each other.

This wiki is the home of support, planning, and education for communities utilizing Althea to build networks. 

## Find your community

Choose your region and see if a community already exists for your area. You can then join as a supporter, organizer, technician, or ambassador. There is power in numbers, and reinventing the wheel doesn't make much sense towards effective progress!

Choose your continent:

* [Africa](#)
* [Antarctica](./regions/antarctica)
* [Asia](#)
* [Oceania](#)
* [Europe](#)
* [North America](#)
* [South America](#)


## Build your community

If you can't find a community for your area, start your own!

You can help your community by:

* Providing the community’s information and intentions
* Collecting and providing the community’s contact information (infrastructure admin, ambassador’s contact information, etc)
* Updating community-specific resources, news, and external news that affect the network *(e.g. changes in laws that affect Althea, city ordinances that affect installed infrasture, security updates for hardware, etc)*
* Being a point-of-contact for anyone wanting to join said community

To start a community, [follow these instructions](#) here.
