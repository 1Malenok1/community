# Althea Communities

In order for Althea networks to deploy, grow, and scale sustainably, communities need to educate and support each other.

This open source repository will be the new home of support, planning, and education for communities utilizing Althea to build networks. 

## Find your community

Before starting a new community, choose your region and see if one already exists suitable for you to join as a supporter, organizer, technician, or ambassador. There is power in numbers, and reinventing the wheel doesn't make much sense towards effective progress!

Choose your continent:

* [Africa](#)
* [Antarctica](./regions/antarctica)
* [Asia](#)
* [Oceania](#)
* [Europe](#)
* [North America](#)
* [South America](#)







## Build a new community

If you can't find a community suitable to join, feel free to start your own!

By starting a community and becoming its ambassador, you will ultimately be responsible for maintaining it and:

* Providing the community’s information and intentions
* Collecting and providing the community’s contact information (infrastructure admin, ambassador’s contact information, etc)
* Updated community-specific resources, news, and external news that affect the network *(e.g. changes in laws that affect Althea, city ordinances that affect installed infrasture, security updates for hardware, etc)*
* Being a point-of-contact for anyone wanting to join said community

To start a community, [follow these instructions](#) here.
