# Althea Community

Althea is a complete ecosystem with complimentary parts components. Each component is a project and community in its own right. These communities consists of a diverse group of builders, developers, partners, and users for every part of the ecosysem. Despite the varying focuses and interests in the community, the same goal is shared of wanting to ensure decentralized connectivity across the globe. With each network and application built the community is committed to providing a place for sharing and organizing for each other.

The ecosystem and its communities are broken up into these components:


|Network|  |

|[Builders](network/builders.md)|From router hackers to full scale network deployment operators, this community knows networking!|
|[Partners](network/partners.md)|Communities and companies alike who build out networks to solve real world connectivity problems|
|[End users](network/end-users.md)|The people who benefit directly from Althea networks the most by using it for their internet regularly!|
