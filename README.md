# Althea Community

Althea is a complete ecosystem built with different components ranging from DeFi to hardware. For this reason, the global Althea community consists of a diverse group of builders, developers, partners, and users for every part of the ecosysem. Despite the varying focuses of community members, we all build together with the same goal of wanting to ensure decentralized connectivity across the globe. As each network is built and each new community springs up, we're committed to providing a place for sharing and organizing. Our community is categorized into these distinct areas of interest:


|Network|  |

|Builders|From router hackers to full scale network deployment operators, this community knows networking!|
|Partners|Communities and companies alike who build out networks to solve real world connectivity problems|
|End users|The people who benefit directly from Althea the most by using it for their internet regularly!|
