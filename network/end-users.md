# Althea End-user Community

The greater Althea end-user community includes all users who interact with networks built on Althea and as such, it's possible for an Althea end-user to not even be aware they are using Althea.
For those that are aware and who want to support Althea as a vision for connectivity, they congregate in several places for discussions, news, and ambassador initiatives.
