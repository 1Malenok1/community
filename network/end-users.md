# Althea End-user Community

The greater Althea end-user community includes all users who interact with networks built on Althea and as such, it's possible for an Althea end-user to not even be aware they are using Althea.
For those that are aware and who want to support Althea as a vision for connectivity, they congregate in several places for discussions, news, and ambassador initiatives.

## Volunteers and Ambassadors

As Althea is more than just an ecosystem comprised of technology but also a movement for connectivity and further decentralizing the internet, there is plenty of room for community initiatives, volunteers, and ambassadors programs to spread the word, grow the community, and make an impact.

To participate as either, you can [apply directly via a Google form here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScv5ssqfQtftfLTM6vf-zUjTLr_gfNyNed3HgQYPnl8lwwAow/viewform?usp=sf_link). Note that if you contact a team member on Discord or elsewhere regarding this, they will also just send you to this Google form.
