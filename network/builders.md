# Althea Network Builder Community

Althea networks are networks built using the Althea ecosystem, which includes the protocol, software on devices, and connectivity hardware. The builder community ranges from hobbyist developers and DIY tinkerers to largescale network operators who climb trees to install antennas. Regardless of what scape you're wanting to build at, you can benefit from the experience and expertise of our community of Althea network builders.

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the community of builders. You may get help with your builds, commit code, write docs, test product features, report bugs, organize meetups, suggest ideas for new features, get organized to cooperatively build with others near you, and more.

### Getting help with your builds

Whenever in doubt, the best thing to do is [jump right into the Discord](https://discord.gg/hHx7HxcycF) and introduce yourself. That will give others a chance to help direct you to the right resources and answer specific questions you might have. 

### Getting started with contributing code

This section needs guideance from Justin. (Is all the code on github, and is there currently a contributor process? Is it more or less a monorepo for Althea's functionality? Or is the code split between different aspects, so that someone contributing code to the protocol or software run on a router is different than where someone contributing to code that would work with the blockchain would be?)

### Writing docs

This section needs guideance from Justin. (Where are docs located? Can they currently be contributed to via github?)

### Reporting bugs / suggesting features

This section needs guideance from Justin. (How are bugs reported? Github issues? Would the same process be used for feature requests as is common on github issues?)

### Organize local meetups / Althea events

Local meetups can be both fun and educational, socializing with other builders near you and sharing experiences and discussing plans. Anyone can organize an informal meetup, but you can find more information on past meetups here to help you.

If you'd like you'd like to organize an official Althea event however, please contact us at ________ after reading the requirements for the events, here.  

### Volunteer to help other builders

If you'd like to volunteer to help other builders, the best way to is to be available on the Discord to answer questions in the #deployments channel.
