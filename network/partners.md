# Althea Network Partner Community

Althea networks are networks built using the Althea ecosystem, which includes the protocol, software on devices, and connectivity hardware. The network partner community ranges from major ISPs businesses to single private network operators. Regardless of what scale you operate at , you can benefit from the experience and expertise of our community of Althea network partners.

This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the community of partners. You may get help with decisions on how to run your network, suggestions on what teams and professionals to use to help set up your network, participate in meetups, have discussions on the economics, and more.

### Consulting on how to set up and run your network

Whenever in doubt, the best thing to do is [jump right into the Althea Partner channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/477147257251299350/843276412651438150) and introduce yourself. That will give others a chance to help direct you to the right resources and answer specific questions you might have.

### Getting started with consulting on your network

Setting up a new private network or as a business will always have some challenges and costs associated with it. The first step to solving them is to understanding what the problems are through consulting with professionals in the community.

You can get help with consulting in the [Althea Partner channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/477147257251299350/843276412651438150), where depending on your area a specific team of network deployment technicians can work with you to set up your network for you, or if you already have the capacity to do that in house you can get some direction from others who have already done it in the community.

### Participate in local meetups / Althea events
